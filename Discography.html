    <h3>5 Most Popular Works</h3>
    <br>
    
    <h4>5. <i>Animals</i>, 1977</h4>
    <p><i>Animals</i>, Pink Floyd's 10th album overall, was a concept album loosely based on George Orwell's <i>Animal Farm</i>. There were no singles released from it, since the only songs that weren't a minute-and-a-half long were over 10 minutes long.<p>

    <h4>4. <i>The Division Bell</i>, 1994</h4>
    <p>Though recorded and written with only two of Pink Floyd's founding members, the 1994 release, <i>The Division Bell</i>, was still able to reach double platinum within the year it was released. It received multiple mixed reviews, but is still one of the most popular Pink Floyd albums.</p>
  
    <h4>3. <i>The Wall</i>, 1979</h4>
    <p><i>The Wall</i> was Pink Floyd's concept album that came directly after <i>Animals</i>, and was almost entirely written and conceptualized by lead singer and bassist, Roger Waters. It's reception, like others, was mixed, however it did extremely well in numer of albums-sold, and its lead single, "Another Brick in the Wall Part 2," reached number 1 on the Billboard chart in 6 countries, including the US and UK. <i>The Wall</i> was certified 23 times platinum 20 years after its release, a monumental achievement.<p/>

    <h4>2. <i>Wish You Were Here</i>, 1975</h4>
    <p>Given their success from their previous album, <i>Wish You Were Here</i> was a hard follow-up album. It was both a loose concept-album and a part-tribute to former and founding member Syd Barrett, who suffered from schizophrenia among other things, and gradually starting to become more and more absent. </p>

    <h4>1. <i>The Dark Side of the Moon</i>, 1973</h4>
    <p><i>The Dark Side of the Moon</i> is by far Pink Floyd's most popular album, and it received all the critical acclaim it deserved. Like others, it's also a concept album, which explores many psychological things, including mental illness, inspired by previously-mentioned former band member Syd Barrett. DSOTM is one of the best-selling albums ever, and even though it was only in the first place on the Billboard 200 for a week, it remained on the chart from 1973 to 1988, totaling 741 weeks.</p>
