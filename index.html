    <p>Pink Floyd started in London in 1965, by art students, who, in their early shows experimented with lights during their performances. Eventually they got some attention from a record label, and released 5 LPs before their huge hit, <i>The Dark Side of the Moon</i>, in 1973. </p>

    <p>After their success with <i>The Dark Side of the Moon</i>, they released 3 more full-length albums, including, in order of releases, <i>Wish You Were Here</i>, <i>Animals</i>, and <i>The Wall</i>, all to great success. Though the band would lose its lead singer, Roger Waters soon after, Pink Floyd have released 4 more albums since, their last and latest in 2014. They have left a lasting impact on popular music. </p>
